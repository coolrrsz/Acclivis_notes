Configure the network settings of the device by doing one of the following:

    Get a dynamic IP address from a DHCP server by running the following commands:

    => setenv autoload no
    => dhcp

    Configure a static IP address, where a.b.c.d is the IP address of your device:

    => setenv ipaddr a.b.c.d

Configure the IP address of the machine where the TFTP server is running and save the configuration as follows, where w.x.y.z is your machine IP address where the TFTP server is running:

=> setenv serverip w.x.y.z
=> saveenv

Update the U-Boot image (optional):

    Execute the following command to update the U-Boot image:

    => update uboot tftp <u-boot-file>.imx

    Reset the board to boot into the recently updated U-Boot, and press any key to stop the autoboot process.

    Reset the U-Boot environment to default values (this will not reset protected variables like the MAC address). To do so, issue this command:

    => env default -a

    Configure the network and TFTP settings on your device again and save the configuration.

Configure the partition of the eMMC for holding Yocto images by running these commands:

=> setenv mmcdev 0
=> run partition_mmc_linux

Update the boot image by executing this command:

=> update linux tftp <boot-file>.boot.vfat

Update the root file system image by issuing this command:

=> update rootfs tftp <rootfs-file>.rootfs.ext4

Update the recovery image by executing this command:

=> update recovery tftp <recovery-file>.recovery.vfat

You can format the update partition or directly boot the new firmware:

    To format the update partition, run the following commands. They boot in recovery mode to format the partition and then boots the device normally with the new firmware:

    => setenv recovery_command wipe_update
    => saveenv
    => run recoverycmd

    If the update partition is already formatted or you want to preserve its contents, boot the device with the firmware you have just programmed:

    => boot
